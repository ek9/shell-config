# This code does amost exactly what the native vcsh sanity checking code
# does except that on finding a potential merge conflict, it moves existing
# files out of the way temporarily. Merging (part of `vcsh clone`) happens
# cleanly, and a post-merge hook can be used to figure out what to do with
# the now-renamed files.
